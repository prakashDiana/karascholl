# Kara Std Font(s)


A standard font.

It has PostScript glyph names.

**GID** | **Name**
--- | ---
0 | .notdef
1 | NULL
2 | CR
3 | space

And more.

It says, “TrueType outline fonts should have the following four glyphs at the glyph ID indicated. These were listed in Apple’s original TrueType specification. These glyphs are recommended to allow for the same version of the font to work on both Windows and Macintosh.”

It also said that the .notdef glyph is very important for providing the user feedback that a glyph is not found in the font. This glyph should not be left without an outline as the user will only see what looks like a space if a glyph is missing and not be aware of the active font’s limitation.

For 16.
